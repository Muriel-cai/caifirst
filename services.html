The completed device is called a biocompatible ferroelectret nanogenerator, or FENG, in the journal Nano Energy.
Demonstration videos show that with the low-cost device, the scientists successfully operated an LCD touch screen, a bank of 20 LED lights and a flexible keyboard, all with a simple touching or pressing motion and without the aid of a battery.
The device can be adapted to many applications and sizes. The nanogenerator used to power the LED lights was palm-sized, while the device used to power the touch screen was as small as a finger.online services and personal digital accessories. 1995 was the year the world's third largest PC supplier, was ranked 'the world's hundred largest information technology company' first top 11, 'the world's 50 largest software companies'  For instance</p>
